##  Topics & Advance Readings

In advance of the design workshop, all participants produced a one-or-two page topic paper to be shared with the other attendees on either:

* A specific problem that they wanted to solve with a web-of-trust solution, and why current solutions (PGP or CA-based PKI) can't address the problem?
* A specific solution related to the web-of-trust that you'd like others to use or contribute to?

Here are the advanced readings to date:

### Primers
These primers overview major topics which are likely to be discussed
at the design workshop. If you read nothing else, read these. (But
really, read as much as you can!)

* [DID Primer](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot7/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/did-primer.md) — Decentralized Identifiers ([extended version](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot7-fall2018/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/did-primer-extended.md) also available)
* [Functional Identity Primer](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot7/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/functional-identity-primer.md) — A different way to look at identity
* [Verifiable Credentials Primer](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot7/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/verifiable-credentials-primer.md) — the project formerly known as Verifiable Claims
* [DIDs In DPKI](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot7/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/dids-in-dpki.md) - how DIDs fit into Decentralized Public-key Infrastructure
